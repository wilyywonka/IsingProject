A quite simple 2D Ising model simulator.

There are two implementations, the Julia implementation seem to work, however it has problems with quenching and thus will, for low temperatures, freeze into position at a higher energy than possible.

The Fortran implementation is not yes functional, but is planned to be fixed.
